## Device support

### TL;DR:

- Android (7.0 and newer) ✅ - Report any issues [here](https://github.com/Bruhtek/Onigiri/issues)
- Kindle browser ❌ - White screen, I am unable to debug on this platform, any contributions welcome, even any idea how
  to open a web console (if it exists) would be helpful.
- Anything else ❓ - Try it and report back!

The app is primarily tested on the Onyx Boox Note Air 2 on Kiwi Browser, as that is the hardware that I own. However, it
should work on any modern E-Ink device that can run a relatively recent browser (except Kindles) and particularly any
Android 7.0+ should be guaranteed to work.

As of time of writing (*2024-12-22*), the following e-readers have Android:

- Any **Onyx Boox**
- Any **inkBoox**
- Some **PocketBooks** (except for the Pocketbook Lite)
