There, the accelerator now extended from Groom Lake to Bald Mountain, boasting a circumference of 120 kilometers. On this day, 150 meters underground, the power output had been increased to confirm the existence of other dimensions. Eventually, the collisional energy reached a point far exceeding that of the Large Halogen Collider. Right as this happened, measurement instruments logged the smashing together of numerous particles into memory. Afterwards, the results appeared on a monitor.</p>\n<p>“...We’ve confirmed the formation of a micro black hole!”</p>\n<p>Cheers rose in unison, symbolizing the moment of a new theory being proven.</p>\n<p>“You’ve done it, Dr. Tyler!”</p>\n<p>The surrounding scientists hurried over to shake the hand of Dr. Theodore Nanase Tyler, who had led the experiment.</p>\n<p>“Great work, Ted!”</p>\n<p>“Oh, anything but <em>that</em> nickname. Do I look like a talking stuffed animal?”</p>\n<p>Laughing, Tyler gripped the man’s hand. This was his moment of glory.</p>\n<p>A young scientist watched with reverence. But after sharing in the excitement for a while, he suddenly noticed something strange on the monitor. Following the experiment’s success, the computer had continued following its programming, processing the information accumulating by the femtosecond. It now displayed some rather...unbelievable results on the monitor.</p>\n<p>“Dr. Tyler, look at this!”</p>\n<p>The young scientist’s involuntary shout—more like a scream—was enough to draw everyone’s attention.</p>\n<p>“What’s wrong?” Tyler asked.</p>\n<p>Young researchers were liable to make small mistakes at any given moment. Tyler had learned that lesson all too well during his long career. He also knew that, during times like these, raising his voice would only make the problem worse.</p>\n<p>Tyler approached the young researcher calmly. However, he couldn’t comprehend the man’s answer when it came.</p>\n<p>“Th-The micro black hole...” The younger scientist hesitated before the words finally burst out. “It hasn’t disappeared!”</p>\n<p>Silence fell over the room. Everyone shared the same thought: <em>That’s absurd.</em></p>\n<p>If the theory proved correct, the micro black hole should have evaporated in a single moment due to Hawking radiation. The mass used in its creation had been no more than a single proton.</p>\n<p>“Multiple micro black holes are moving rapidly throughout the space! It’s…” The younger researcher struggled to describe what he was seeing. “It’s like some kind of force field has taken hold of them!”</p>\n<p class=\"centerp\">***</p>\n<p>At first, there was nothing more than a distortion of space on a quantum level. <em>IT</em> recognized this distortion, occurring within a single moment of time, as a once-in-a-lifetime chance to grant <em>ITS</em> wish. And so, <em>IT</em> grabbed hold of the distortion, carefully adding energy to it, making it expand.</p>\n<h2>Washington, D.C., United States of America</h2>\n<p><em>“Th-There’s some kind of huge mass inside the fixed force field... What the hell </em>is<em> that?!”</em></p>\n<p>As someone’s cries echoed through the speaker, a white light covered the monitor, and the video ended.</p>\n<p>“Is that everything?”</p>\n<p>A nervous-looking man in a magnificent, three-piece suit from Chester Barrie refolded his legs after asking that question. </p>\n<p>“Yes,” reported a subordinate. “This is the only footage recorded at ground control of the accelerator experiment, which was conducted at Groom Lake Air Force Base.”</p>\n<p>“In other words, ground control is intact? And what about the nuclear power plant? The one built to supply the base with energy.”</p>\n<p>The nightmare of Three Mile Island flashed through the man’s mind. Despite this happening in Nevada, he wanted to avoid a repeat of that incident.</p>\n<p>“There hasn’t been any significant effect on the surface,” continued the subordinate. “We’ve only lost contact with the underground, where the accelerator was built. The nuclear plant is fine.”</p>\n<p>“What about the micro black hole?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know. But whatever happens to it, I can’t imagine that it’ll continue growing and consume the earth.”</p>\n<p>Hearing this, the other man in the Chester Barrie suit relaxed, nodding. “And what about the rescue mission?”</p>\n<p>“Initially, members of the base carried out the operation, yet anything resembling an elevator was completely shut down, not moving in the slightest. As such, the rescue team used the emergency stairs at point three on the west side of Bald Mountain to gain access. However...”</p>\n<p>The subordinate projected a still image on the monitor.</p>\n<p>“...What’s this?” asked the man in the Chester Barrie suit. “The latest action flick from Hollywood?”</p>\n<p>The image depicted something humanoid with a dreadful face and bluish skin.</p>\n<p>“This creature is over ten feet tall,” answered the subordinate. “It’s the first lifeform that the raiding squadron encountered.”</p>\n<p>Had this been a fantasy movie, the creature would have been called a troll or ogre.</p>\n<p>“The first two soldiers who immediately opened fire were killed,” the subordinate continued. “Their GAU-5A ASDWs were about as effective as peashooters.”</p>\n<p>“Were those scientists experimenting on a teleportation device between Phobos and Deimos?”</p>\n<p>Dumbfounded, the man in the Chester Barrie suit let slip the setting of a game he’d played obsessively in his youth. Nevertheless, he soon shook his head, firing off a few orders.</p>\n<p class=\"centerp\">***</p>\n<p>The organism seemed to act with intelligence, performing with intent. <em>ITS</em> organs, which unceasingly generated weak yet complex electrical currents, suggested various things to <em>IT</em>. Between a moment and eternity, <em>IT</em> trembled with joy, unleashing vast resources. All to fulfill <em>ITS</em> own desires.</p>\n<p>On this day, one hundred and fifty meters beneath Groom Lake, the first dungeon was born. Later, it would become known as The Ring.</p>\n<h2>Present, September 2018</h2>\n<h2>Nevada, Area 51 Dungeon Laboratory</h2>\n<p>At the end of September, the daytime temperature of Nevada still exceeded twenty-five degrees Celsius. A hot, dry wind blew across the land.</p>\n<p>In a certain government laboratory, Director Aaron Ainsworth raised his voice. “Has the dungeon passage theory been proven?”</p>\n<p>According to this theory, dungeons were passageways leading somewhere unknown. Similar to the hollow Earth theory, this was but another wild speculation. Even so, the media had reported on it for their own amusement. Once it had become known that dungeons existed in “pocket dimensions” separate from Earth, some researchers had taken to studying the theory seriously. Of course, the most ardent supporters of it were questionable religious groups and dubious, self-proclaimed “researchers” who were popular with the media.</p>\n<p>“Proven, sir?” A liaison officer spoke up. “That might be a little hasty.”</p>\n<p>Underneath Aaron’s glare, the liaison officer timidly explained. Exactly one month ago, a particular skill orb had been found in the Ob River basin of Russia. More precisely, in a dungeon between Surgut and Nizhnevartovsk. The skill contained within that orb had been “Otherworldly Language Comprehension.”</p>\n<p>The orb had been immediately sent to Moscow, but due to some bad weather with unfortunate timing, the plane hadn’t been able to take off. Right before the orb had disappeared, it had been used by someone who happened to be in the vicinity while in possession of a D-Card.</p>\n<p>“So, has the name of the skill recipient been disclosed?” Aaron asked. “Given that the skill is academic, there shouldn’t be any way of hiding the user’s name.”</p>\n<p>“Yes. According to the published paper, the recipient’s name is Ignat Severni.”</p>\n<p>As far as Aaron knew, there were no dungeon researchers with that name in Russia.</p>\n<p>“Here are the contents of the announcement,” continued the liaison officer, offering a memory card. “It’s a partial translation of an inscription found in a dungeon.”</p>\n<p>Snatching the memory card from the officer, Aaron inserted it into the slot of his tablet. Then he entered his passcode, immediately opening the file. The contents were shocking.</p>\n<p>“Dungeons are terraforming tools?”</p>\n<p>According to this file, the dungeons—driven into the Earth like needles—were a means of creating a substance called “magicules.” Apparently, this substance filled the otherworld. And apparently the otherworld wanted to terraform foreign worlds. If a world selected for terraforming lacked magicules, dungeons would send out this substance in the form of monsters.</p>\n<p>If true, this action could certainly be described as terraforming. And apparently, dungeons with over one hundred and twenty-eight levels were passageways to the otherworld.</p>\n<p>“If this is true, it would be more than shocking,” said Aaron. “It would cause an uproar.”</p>\n<p>“I agree.”</p>\n<p>Yet for now, only one man—Ignat Severni—could understand the contents of the inscription. No one could verify what he claimed to have translated. For now, only God and God alone could prove that he hadn’t merely recreated his delusions on paper.</p>\n<p>“To verify these claims, someone else would have to obtain the same skill orb and read the inscription,” the officer commented.</p>\n<p>“Has the monster who drops them been confirmed to exist in the US?”</p>\n<p>“The drop monster hasn’t been officially announced. But the skill orb was found in the Kiryas Kul’yegan Dungeon. It’s located where the Reka Kul’yegan connects to the Ob River. In accordance with the International Dungeon Treaty, the monsters within the captured range have been made public. So, if we research them one by one...”</p>\n<p>Hearing this, Aaron sighed. “It’s a roundabout solution, but I suppose we have no other choice.”</p>\n<p>From the window behind his desk, he gazed at the Nevada landscape, the sun dimming. At the end of September, dusk arrived along with rapidly cooling temperatures. Had the chilly air caused him to shiver? If not, had it been due to the power of <em>something</em> just one hundred and fifty meters below his feet?</p>\n<p>And so, night fell over Nevada.<br/><br/></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><b>Annotations</b></p>\n<p><em>GAU-5A ASDW: </em>US Air Force survival rifle (Aircrew Self-Defense Weapon).</li></p>\n<p><em>Were those scientists experimenting on a teleportation device between Phobos and Deimos?: </em>The setting of <em>DOOM</em>.

Although autumn deepened, the heat index inside the vehicle was rising.</p>\n<p>“So, did everything go well?”</p>\n<p>The cause behind the skyrocketing heat index posed this question in a displeased tone from the other side of my hands-free phone call. The voice belonged to Yoshitake Enoki—my boss, after a fashion.</p>\n<p>After a mistake in his management had angered a client, he’d sent me—a lowly employee—to apologize. No wonder the client doubted his sincerity.</p>\n<p>“No,” I replied. “Looks like they’re terminating the deal...”</p>\n<p>“What?! And just how did you apologize to them?”</p>\n<p>“In response to such a serious incident, you sent out someone else to do your grunt work, and you expected anything less? Are you an idiot?” That’s what I wanted to ask. What I really, <em>really</em> wanted to ask.</p>\n<p>“I hear what you’re saying,” I replied instead. “Even so, I wasn’t directly involved in this situation.”</p>\n<p>Sure, various departments used me for their convenience, but I <em>was</em> a researcher, more or less. This was a sales job. Furthermore, I hadn’t been given a sufficient explanation for the situation. Until I met the client, I hadn’t known the problem was a failure in product development due to a misuse of DGB-2473.</p>\n<p>“What are you talking about?” Enoki asked. “Your team created the materials, right?”</p>\n<p><em>Huh? Where do you get off saying that? You’re the one who sold the materials to an environment outside the guaranteed range.</em></p>\n<p>“But aren’t there annotations about DGB-2473 in the user’s manual?” I asked. “If used outside the guaranteed environment, it won’t produce the specified values. That much should be ob—”</p>\n<p>“Did you explain that to the sales department?”</p>\n<p><em>No, I didn’t. Still, before carelessly claiming that something is usable, you should </em>at least<em> read the instructions of the materials you’re selling.</em></p>\n<p>“No, not directly,” I answered.</p>\n<p>“In that case, this is <em>your</em> team’s mistake.”</p>\n<p>On the other end of the phone, Enoki ranted about proper business protocol. <em>Ugh, I’ve had enough of this guy.</em></p>\n<p>“I’m sorry,” I said.</p>\n<p>“You’re sorry? In other words, you’re admitting that this is your screwup. You really are useless. We’re done here. Since you lost such an important client, I’ll be docking your pay. Don’t expect any bonuses either.”</p>\n<p><em>What? I wasn’t even involved in this mess. This is all thanks to</em> your<em> crappy management!</em></p>\n<p>Just as I tried to voice my complaints, Enoki hung up. Figures.</p>\n<p>I sighed. This was all so absurd. A dock in pay? No bonus? What had Enoki been on about? <em>“If we succeed, it’s all thanks to me; but if we fail, you’re to blame.”</em> How did a guy like that end up as anyone’s boss?</p>\n<p>“Then again, he’s probably gotten that far ahead <em>because</em> he’s that sort of person...”</p>\n<p>If you merely looked at his profile, he had an amazing work history.</p>\n<p>“Ugh, I feel like dying.” I sighed again. “How am I supposed to go back to work…?”</p>\n<p>The rain pounding against the roof of my car grew louder. Turning on the engine, cheerful music started playing on the radio. Perhaps I could raise my spirits, even a little. Gripping the steering wheel with my left hand, I lifted its index finger to tap out the song’s rhythm. As I turned on the windshield wipers, the music suddenly cut off.</p>\n<p>“Huh?”</p>\n<p>“Breaking news,” the radio announcer said. “In America, a mid-depth dungeon has finally been captured!”</p>\n<p>“Incredible!” someone else replied.</p>\n<p>It sounded like this development had caused quite the stir within the news studio. Hearing that a mid-depth dungeon had been captured didn’t mean that much to me, but apparently it was important enough for a news flash.</p>\n<p>“There must have been some incredible items inside a mid-depth dungeon,” noted someone in the news studio.</p>\n<p>Three years had already passed since dungeons first appeared in the world. The initial chaos had died down, and exploring dungeons had become as commonplace as fishing in slightly dangerous locations. Defeating a monster sounded dangerous, but the act itself wasn’t too different from hunting or fishing. To some extent, each of those activities posed life-threatening risks.</p>\n<p><em>Maybe diving into a dungeon and having one of those “adventures” would help me blow off some steam.</em></p>\n<p>While considering this, I started the car. This area—located around the outer gardens of Meiji Shrine—boasted many structures related to the Olympics. Even now, construction had just started on several large buildings. </p>\n<p>As the rain picked up momentum, the sound of water pounding against the rooftop resounded throughout my car.</p>\n<p>“Given that it’s been three years since the dungeons appeared, this feels like a long time in the making,” said the radio announcer. “Today, we welcome dungeon researcher Haruki Yoshida. Thank you for being here, Mr. Yoshida.”</p>\n<p><em>Haruki Yoshida, huh? </em></p>\n<p>I’d heard that name a lot lately, but I was skeptical of him being a researcher. After all, no one knew his dungeon rank. Did he even dive?</p>\n<p>“Thank you for having me,” replied Yoshida.</p>\n<p>“The mid-depth dungeon was captured in Denver, Colorado—part of Area 36. Known as Evans Dungeon, it was discovered in Summit Lake of Mount Evans, and it’s been said to contain thirty-one levels. What are your thoughts on the matter, Mr. Yoshida?”</p>\n<p>“Only a small number of minor-depth dungeons, which are up to twenty levels, have been fully traversed. As such, this is quite the accomplishment.”</p>\n<p>“I see. Incidentally, what exactly <em>is</em> a mid-depth dungeon?”</p>\n<p>“Great question. So far, about eighty dungeons have been discovered throughout the world, and for the sake of convenience, they’ve been classified into three categories: minor-depth, mid-depth, and massive-depth.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve heard the term ‘deep underground’ before, but that doesn’t appear to be in use here.”</p>\n<p>“Correct. ‘Deep underground’ was originally an MLIT term—that is, a term used by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism. For MLIT, ‘deep underground’ was used to describe a concept related to subterranean utilization up until now. Therefore, it wasn’t suited to dungeon classification, and to prevent misunderstandings, new concepts were created.”</p>\n<p>“I see.”</p>\n<p>“Dungeons are defined by their number of floors. Those with less than twenty-one are minor-depth, and those with less than eighty are mid-depth. Anything greater than that is a massive-depth dungeon.”</p>\n<p>Actually, I’d heard another rumor. As a result of various military-funded dungeon dives, the boundary in which small arms became ineffective had been used to determine the classifications.</p>\n<p>“Well then, despite being mid-depth, Evans Dungeon wasn’t very deep, was it?” the announcer asked.</p>\n<p>“No, it’s hard to say anything for certain, as these classifications are merely for the sake of convenience,” replied Yoshida. “For starters, we still haven’t identified a massive-depth dungeon that meets its exact definition. To give an example, the Self-Defense Force’s countermeasures team has reached the twenty-first level of Yoyogi Dungeon in Tokyo. Thus, we’ve confirmed Yoyogi to be a mid-depth dungeon or higher, but...”</p>\n<p>“Until descending farther, we won’t know the actual number of levels?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right. If twenty-one or more levels are found during an actual descent, we know the dungeon to be mid-depth. However, very few dungeons have been captured to such an extent. Seeing as no one has reached level eighty, we don’t know whether such a floor exists in any dungeon.”</p>\n<p>“I see. So, it’s possible that dungeons are only thirty-one levels?”</p>\n<p>“Until someone reaches the thirty-second level, that remains a possibility.”</p>\n<p>“However, it’s been announced that there are five minor-depth and four mid- to massive-depth dungeons in Japan. How do we know this?”</p>\n<p>“Those are merely estimates. Right now, by measuring a particular sort of vibration that occurs during the formation of a dungeon—otherwise known as a dungeon tremor—we can estimate the depth of the underground space occupied by the dungeon. The JDA refers to this as ‘dungeon depth’, expressing the number in meters.”</p>\n<p>“Incredible.”</p>\n<p>“In a country as earthquake-prone as Japan, we already had Hi-net and GEONET in place when the dungeons first appeared. By comparing the records of those systems, we were able to estimate the approximate depth of known dungeons. Even so, the insides of dungeons are mysterious spaces. In reality, we don’t even know if there’s a strict relationship between the number of levels and a dungeon’s depth. ‘If the occupied area has a great depth, there should be a large number of floors, right?’ That’s about as much as we know.”</p>\n<p>“So that’s how it works.”</p>\n<p>“Two minor-depth dungeons have already been fully traversed in Japan. By comparing their levels to the calculated dungeon depths, we can make an analogical inference about the number of floors in other dungeons. That’s the basis for our previously mentioned estimate.”</p>\n<p>“Makes perfect sense. By the way, I’ve heard that several skill orbs were dropped on the lowest level of Evans Dungeon. Unfortunately, the details haven’t been announced.”</p>\n<p>“Well, of everything you can obtain from a dungeon, everyone dreams of finding an orb.”</p>\n<p>“Skill orbs, huh...?” I muttered to myself.</p>\n<p class=\"centerp\">***</p>\n<p>The appearance of dungeons had led to a massive global disturbance. After all, much like a fantasy world, monsters prowled dungeon interiors. Still, a small increase in places like the taiga and tropical rainforests, where carnivorous beasts dangerous to human society already lurked, wouldn’t have been very significant.</p>\n<p>What had truly shaken the world were the three items obtainable from dungeons: cards, potions, and skill orbs. The first dungeon card—D-Card for short—to be discovered had rocked the scientific community as a highly futuristic piece of technology. Even so, these items hadn’t directly impacted our lives in any significant way.</p>\n<p>When someone first defeated a monster, it would drop a card containing the person’s name and various informative details. That was the extent of the phenomenon. Even now, D-Cards were most commonly used to check the skills of explorers. </p>\n<p>Yet at first, everyone had been under the impression that they were far more mysterious objects. A string of fourteen small letters were engraved upon the upper back side of each card. The strange characters used in these engravings had caused a small stir within the philological community, but seeing as they couldn’t possibly be deciphered, the letters had simply been collected into different categories.</p>\n<p>Later, tablet-shaped sheets had been discovered in The Ring, the writing on their surfaces matching the engraved character strings on D-Cards. Following this discovery, these letters had once again become a popular topic throughout society, but nothing more had come of them.</p>\n<p>However, the next discovery—potions—proved to be completely different. The first potion had been dropped on top of a dying soldier, whose lower body had been severed from his torso. By sheer coincidence, the soldier used this potion, leading to a worldwide sensation. As if to make a mockery of modern medical science, the lower half of his body had reconnected to his torso. Thus, he had returned from the seemingly inevitable grasp of death.</p>\n<p>This was enough to convince governments, armies, and even famous corporations to take the initiative and send people into dungeons. Afterwards, due to the various items discovered within them, dungeons were recognized as something like mines for special resources.</p>\n<p>During all this, the first skill orb had also been discovered. In short, these were items guiding humanity to a higher status, granting those who used them the ability to wield magic. Objects that could transform fiction into reality—these were none other than skill orbs.</p>\n<p>At the moment, serious debates about the heredity of these abilities were ongoing. Soldiers on the frontlines would supposedly register their genetic maps before expeditions. Following the use of an orb, these would serve as comparisons. </p>\n<p>If the first orb user had conceived a child immediately after finding and gaining their skill, that boy or girl should have already been born. Regardless, no such news had been reported on. It was rumored that less democratic countries were using artificial insemination to mass produce such children.</p>\n<p>In any case, skill orbs were in circulation, and if they were used for crime, world order would be liable to collapse. Fearing this, government administrators had immediately established the WDA—the World Dungeon Association—to manage dungeon-produced items. Yet in the end, they hadn’t been able to manage skill orbs. Despite being stored with the utmost security, the first few orbs gathered from various regions had disappeared from their warehouses.</p>\n<p>Naturally, there had been suspicions of wrongdoing and of employees selling them on the black market. But since this had occurred intermittently across the world, it had been difficult to attribute every case to human action, even if they were few in number.</p>\n<p>Later, strict surveillance had confirmed that skill orbs disappeared exactly twenty-three hours, fifty-six minutes, and four seconds after appearing in the world, matching the time of the Earth’s rotation. This meant that the distribution of skill orbs was incredibly complex. Likewise, there were many conflicting opinions on how to handle them in a legal sense.</p>\n<p>Due to their extreme rarity, an economic value hadn’t been determined, and if left unused, their value would drop to zero in twenty-four hours. It had become a matter of debate whether such an item could be independently regarded as property. Various interpretations had been attempted, but at present, skill orbs weren’t considered private property due to their uncontrollability. Legally, it had been decided that the free use of skill orbs couldn’t be considered a gift or transfer.</p>\n<p>Even if skill orbs were considered tangible objects, all of them were products of nature. In other words, they were moveable property without owners. Thus, even if Person A obtained a skill orb, it would remain ownerless property unless he or she claimed ownership. And if Person A transferred a skill orb to Person B, that would simply be a physical means of moving ownerless property. Unless someone in the middle of this process claimed ownership of the orb, it would—in the end—be considered the possession of whoever <em>used</em> it, regardless of whatever route it took.</p>\n<p>Obviously, if any buying or selling occurred during this interval, a dungeon tax would be imposed. And so, the world had failed to manage skill orbs. But in the end, global order hadn’t collapsed either. After all, very few orbs existed, and the number of users unknown to WDA administrators was even fewer.</p>\n<p>And of course, crimes using the power of orbs might not have been recognized as such; consequently, they wouldn’t come to light. Likewise, such crimes had probably existed before the appearance of orbs, and as a result, it seemed as though nothing had changed in the grand scheme of things.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, people who hadn’t materialized a D-Card couldn’t use orbs. If someone wished to receive the benefits of one, they would have to defeat a monster at least once. No matter how low the chances of obtaining an orb happened to be, it was best to prepare in advance, as your chance would only last for a day. A surprising number of people thought this way, especially in developed countries.</p>\n<p>When the dungeons had first appeared, each and every government had fallen into panic, their responses always one or two steps behind. Yet within a year, laws and management systems had settled into place. Thanks to various governments and the WDA, many dungeons had become manageable.</p>\n<p class=\"centerp\">***</p>\n<p>“Finding an orb would be one hell of a get-rich-quick scheme,” I said. “But one of those will never make its way to the general public.”</p>\n<p>Though rumors of teleportation magic or discovering a mystical item box flew around the web, information about orb users tended to be concealed. For this reason, none of it was very credible. Of course, if someone wanted to publicize their personal information, they were free to do so. Even if it made their world slightly more inconvenient, they would certainly draw attention.</p>\n<p>And thus, groups like Dg48 were born in the entertainment industry. If you gave a skill orb to your favorite celeb, you could go on a quasi-date with them until it disappeared. “The handshake ticket business sure has come a long way,” some people said, mocking the practice. Sure, it might have been unprincipled, but I suppose that was what it meant to live audaciously.</p>\n<p>“I could learn a thing or two from them...”</p>\n<p>When the traffic light turned green, I stepped on the accelerator, starting the car. Just then, it bounced, the feeling of tires leaving the road traveling up my hips.</p>\n<p>“Wh-What the hell?!”</p>\n<p>Multiple cars that had been crossing the intersection now crashed together, causing accidents everywhere.</p>\n<p>“Oh crap!”</p>\n<p>Trying to get off the road, I yanked the steering wheel, and ended up swerving into some kind of construction site. My front tire caught inside a deep fissure running through the ground, making my car spin. Now that things had come to this, I had no choice but to take my foot off the accelerator and wait.</p>\n<p>As my car performed a clean spin, I noticed a small shadow at its side. But the vehicle’s movements were outside of my control—I heard a loud thud beneath my car. I immediately broke out in a cold sweat.</p>\n<p>“Don’t tell me...”</p>\n<p>That couldn’t have been a person, right? Judging from the size, it would have been a child.</p>\n<p>I’d hit the object pretty hard. If someone had gotten caught up in that, they would have suffered more than a scratch or two. From within my spinning car, I prayed for the person’s safety as I frantically looked around the area.</p>\n<p>Right before I crashed into a semi-trailer truck carrying a large quantity of rebar, the car finally stopped. Throwing open the door, I dashed into the rain, searching for whatever I’d hit. As the downpour intensified, I struggled to see through the misty spray. Even so, something black had collapsed next to the truck, just a short distance ahead of me.</p>\n<p>“Hey, are you all right?!”</p>\n<p>Panicking, I raced over to the shadow, but just as I started to extend a hand, I noticed something odd about it. I’d seen this creature in a number of videos, but this was my first time viewing one in the flesh. And no, it wasn’t a person.</p>\n<p>“A g-goblin?”</p>\n<p>As I muttered these words, the creature resembling a goblin transformed into black particles before my very eyes. In that spot, only a single card of dull silver remained. <br/><br/></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><code>Name: Keigo Yoshimura</code></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><code>Area: 12</code></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><code>Rank: 99,726,438</code><br/><br/></p>\n<p>The first time a person defeated a monster, this card—a dungeon card—always dropped. A great deal remained unknown about these cards, such as how they obtained the owner’s name and recorded details. For a short while, the cards had been rumored to contain rare metal, but they were apparently created from common materials.</p>\n<p>The area section displayed the location where the card had materialized. Based on inductive conjecture from the information on dungeon cards, it had been speculated that the longitude of 110 to 120 degrees west was Area 1. Thereafter, with every ten degrees of longitude in the direction of Earth’s rotation, the area number would increase by one, coming full circle at Area 36. Recently, an Inuit man from Pond Inlet had acquired an Area 0 card. Thus, some people had said the polar regions must have been set as Area 0.</p>\n<p>In any case, being at 139 degrees east longitude, Tokyo stood on the eastern edge of Area 12.</p>\n<p>“Rank 99,726,438, huh?”</p>\n<p>Supposedly, a person’s rank used something obtained from monsters—for convenience’s sake, it was called “experience points”, imitating video games—to place all of humanity in order. Since I’d just killed my first goblin, there were more than ninety-nine million people in the world who had defeated more monsters than me.</p>\n<p>Still, one seventieth of humanity had already come into contact with monsters. I couldn’t tell if that number was large or small.</p>\n<p>Considering this absentmindedly, I let out a deep breath, muttering to myself. “Whatever. Just glad it wasn’t a child.”</p>\n<p>I pocketed the card and started to relax, leaning back against the semi-trailer truck. Confused voices and smoke rose from the intersection. Apparently, a large earthquake had just occurred.</p>\n<p>“Is my apartment going to be okay?” I wondered out loud.</p>\n<p>After all, I lived in a shabby, two-story apartment building some fifty years old. If it got crushed in a large earthquake, it wouldn’t be the least bit strange.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I was already soaking wet. Even if I went back to work, I didn’t have a change of clothes. I decided to return home for a little while, and—</p>\n<p>While thinking this, I slid backwards, hitting the ground.</p>\n<img src=\"https://d2dq7ifhe7bu0f.cloudfront.net/Part-622f9931e2086aa05596a75c/insert1.jpg\"/>\n<p>“Ouch! What just happened?”</p>\n<p>Turning around, I found the truck loaded with rebar moving backwards and sinking into something.</p>\n<p>“Huh?!”</p>\n<p>A large, deep fissure stretched across the ground, consuming the falling truck. I must have given the precariously balanced vehicle one final push over the edge. Fortunately, the truck stopped while only half-submerged in the crevice. Even so, the large quantity of rebar—incredibly long and thick—continued sliding into the hole.</p>\n<p>“Um, yeah, that fissure just naturally swallowed up the truck, right? This has nothing to do with me, okay? I can’t possibly pay for—”</p>\n<p>Breaking out in a cold sweat, I watched the massive amount of rebar plunging into the crevice. In any case, the pouring rain had already soaked me from head to foot, so what did a bit of cold sweat matter? As similarly incomprehensible thoughts crossed my mind, the sound of rebar hitting the bottom never rang out, no matter how much time passed.</p>\n<p>I circled over to the side of the fissure, wondering if maybe the rebar hadn’t fallen after all. Alongside a faint crashing sound, an eerie voice reverberated from the depths of the Earth, like a violent aftershock assaulting me.</p>\n<p>“Wha—?!”</p>\n<p>From within my body, I felt as if something were forcing me upwards. At the same time, a dizzying sensation overcame me. Once this passed, I opened my eyes, and discovered that a beautiful, rainbow-colored orb had appeared in front of me.</p>\n<p>Upon catching sight of the orb, I fled, calculating the rebar’s fall distance in my head. It had been in free fall for around twenty seconds, and I assumed a diameter of four centimeters and a length of about ten meters. In that case, the fall distance would have been more than...a thousand meters.</p>\n<p>“Even if the rebar fell vertically, reaching terminal velocity seems unlikely.”</p>\n<p>As I muttered these words to myself for no apparent reason, the orb continued floating before my eyes.</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n</body>\n</html>\n
